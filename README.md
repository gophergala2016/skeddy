# skeddy

A time based scheduler which does nothing but handoff the heavy lifting to a bunch of http endpoints. Optional payload can be sent to these http endpoints.

# TODO

Provide a view to add, edit and delete entries in the scheduler. Functionality to restart the scheduler when entries are added and deleted.
